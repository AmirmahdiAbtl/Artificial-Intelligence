# Hunt and Hunter problem with Genetic algorithm 

In this problem we have a list of hunt and hunter animals that said us which animal hunt another and then we should sort a list that a hunter and hunt are in a right situation ( if animal 2 hunt 4 so 2 must become sooner in our list )

## Description

For example we have this list
<p>1 2</p>
<p>3 1</p>
<p>3 2</p>
<p>4 1</p>
<p>4 2</p>
<p>4 3</p>
So it means our output must be like this : 4 3 1 2
