# 8-Puzzle problem with A* algorithm

The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in orde

## Description

8-Puzzle Game is a simple puzzle game. Which is played on 3x3 board. One tile of board is empty and other 8 tiles are numbered from 1 to 8. Our goal is to set tiles in ascending order by moving tiles with blank tile. Blank tile only can UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT. Blank tile only move able with adjacent tiles. It can not move diagonally. I solved the Puzzle with A* (A star) algorithm. which quite famous algorithm in Graph searching. It explore all nodes and gave us optimal path with lowest possible path cost. I Developed all this project in Python Notebook. This project is developed Artificial Intelligence (AI) course as Assignment.
